# Moonlight - Using Processing

Moonlight is a group project that I worked on for my CIS111B - Java Part 2 course while pursing my Information Science &
Technology A.S degree at Montgomery County Community College. The project used Processing which is a graphical library
that helps non-programmers learn how to code in a visual context. I worked on this project as the lead programmer along
with two other students for about two months with no prior knowledge about Processing. Moonlight was made as a animated
backdrop for DJ's to use while playing music. Songs can be added, removed, and paused and the animation changes based
on the frequency of the current song. For more information regarding the project please visit the link posted below. 

**Project Duration: October 2018 - December 2018**
